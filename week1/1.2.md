# Python for Everybody

## 1.2 Hardware Overview

### Terms
* Central Processing Unit
* Main Memory
* Secondary Memory Unit
* Input/Output Devices

The high-level definitions of these parts are as follows:
* The Central Processing Unit (or CPU) is the part of the computer that is
built to be obsessed with “what is next?” If your computer is rated at 3.0
Gigahertz, it means that the CPU will ask “What next?” three billion times
per second. You are going to have to learn how to talk fast to keep up with
the CPU.
* The Main Memory is used to store information that the CPU needs in a
hurry. The main memory is nearly as fast as the CPU. But the information
stored in the main memory vanishes when the computer is turned off.
* The Secondary Memory is also used to store information, but it is much
slower than the main memory. The advantage of the secondary memory is
that it can store information even when there is no power to the computer.
* The Input and Output Devices are ways we interact with the computer.

As a programmer you will mostly be “talking” to the CPU and telling
it what to do next. Sometimes you will tell the CPU to use the main memory,
secondary memory, network, or the input/output devices.
