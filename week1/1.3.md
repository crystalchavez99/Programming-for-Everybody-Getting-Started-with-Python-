# Python for Everybody

## 1.3 Python as a Language

Two skills to be a programmer:
1. need to know the programming language
2. There is a skill and art in
constructing the story, and skill in story writing is improved by doing some
writing and getting some feedback. In programming, our program is the
“story” and the problem you are trying to solve is the “idea”.

We start reading
and explaining programs, then we write simple programs, and then we write increasingly
complex programs over time
