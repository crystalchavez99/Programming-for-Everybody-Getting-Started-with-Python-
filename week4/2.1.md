# Python for Everybody

## 2.1 Expressions

### Constants
* Fixed values such as numbers, letters, and strings are called constants because their value does not change
  * String constants use single or double quotes

### Variables
* Variable is a named place in memory where a programmer can store data and later retrieve using the variable name
* Can choose the names of the variables
* Can change the contents of a variable in a later statement
```Python
x = 12.2
y = 14
x = 100
# x is no longer 12.2
```
### Python Variable Name Rules
* Must state with a letter or underscore
* Must consist of letters, numbers, and numberscores
* Case Sensitive
```
Good: spam, eggs, sam12, _speed
Bad: 23spam, #sign,
var . 12
```
### Assignment Statements
* We assign a value to a variable using statement statement ( aka equal sign = )
* Assignment statement consists of an expression on right hand side and variable to store result
```Python
x = 3.9 * x * (1 - x )
```

### Numeric Expressions
* Lack of mathematical symbols on computer keyboards, we use computer-speak to express classic math operations
* Asterik is mulitplicaion
* Exponentiation looks different than in math


| Operator |  Operation |
|---|---|
|  + | Addition  |
|  - | Subtraction  |
|  * | Multiplication  |
|  / |  Division |
|  ** | Power |
|  % | Remainder  |

### Order of Evaluation
* When we string operators together Python must know which one to do first
* Operator Precedence

#### Operator Precedence Rules
* Highest precedence rule to lowest:
  * Parentheses always respected
  * Exponentiation
  * Mulitplication, Division, Remainder
  * Addition and Subtraction
  * Left to right
```python
1 + 2 ** 3 / 4 * 5 => solve (2 ** 3)
1 + 8 / 4 * 5 => solve (8 / 4)
1 + 2 * 5 => solve (2 * 5)
1 + 10 => solve
11
```
#### Operator Precedence
* Remember rules top to bottom
* when writing code use parentheses
* keept mathematical expressions simple
* break long series of math ops up to make more clear

### What does Type mean?
* Python variables, literals, and constants have a type
* Python knows difference between integer number and string
* "+" means add if number or concatenate if string

### Type Matters
* Some operations are prohibited
* cannot add 1 to string
* can ask Python what type something is using type(value)
```python
type('hello')
# <class 'str'>

eee = eee + 1
# error
```
### Several Types of Numbers
* Numbers have two main types:
  * Integers are whole numbers
  * Floating Point Numbers have decimals
* There are other types

### Type Conversions
* Putting an int and float in expression, integer is implicity converted to float
* can control this with built-in functions `int(value)` and `float(value)`

### Integer Division
* Integer division produces a floating point result
```python
print(10 / 2)
# 5.0
```

### String Conversions
* can use `int()` and `float()` to convert between strings and ints
* can get an error if string does not contain numeric characters


### User Input
* can instruct Python to pause and read data from the user using `input('prompt')`
* returns a string
```python
name = input('Who are you?')
print('Welcome',name)
# Who are you?
# Chuck
# Welcome Chuck
```
