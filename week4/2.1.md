# Python for Everybody

## 2.1 Expressions

### Constants
* Fixed values such as numbers, letters, and strings are called constants because their value does not change
  * String constants use single or double quotes

### Variables
* Variable is a named place in memory where a programmer can store data and later retrieve using the variable name
* Can choose the names of the variables
* Can change the contents of a variable in a later statement
```Python
x = 12.2
y = 14
x = 100
# x is no longer 12.2
```
### Python Variable Name Rules
* Must state with a letter or underscore
* Must consist of letters, numbers, and numberscores
* Case Sensitive
```
Good: spam, eggs, sam12, _speed
Bad: 23spam, #sign,
var . 12
```
### Assignment Statements
* We assign a value to a variable using statement statement ( aka equal sign = )
* Assignment statement consists of an expression on right hand side and variable to store result
```Python
x = 3.9 * x * (1 - x )
```
