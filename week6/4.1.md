# Python for Everybody

## 4.1 Using Functions

* `function` is a named sequence of statements that
performs a computation.

* When you define a `function`, you specify the name and
the sequence of statements. Later, you can “call” the function by name.

```python
def thing(stri):
    print('hello')
    print('fun')
    print(stri)

thing("tea")
# hello
# fun
# tea
```

* refer example above
  * name of function is thing
  * The expression in parentheses is called the argument of the function.
    * The argument is a value or variable that we are passing into the function as input to the function
  * The result is called the return value

### Built In Functions

* Python provides a number of important built-in functions that we can use withoutneeding to provide the function definition
* The `max` and `min` functions give us the largest and smallest values in a list, respectively:

```python
max('Hello world')
# w
min('Hello world')
# ' '
```

### Type conversion functions

* Python also provides built-in functions that convert values from one type to another.
  * The `int` function takes any value and converts it to an integer,if it can
  * `float` converts integers and strings to floating-point numbers
  * `str` converts its argument to a string:
