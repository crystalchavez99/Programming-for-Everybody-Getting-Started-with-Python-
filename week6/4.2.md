# Python for Everybody

## 4.1 Building Functions

### Building Our Own Functions

* We create a new function using the keyword `def` followed by optional parameter in parentheses
* indent body of the function
* defines the function but does not execute it

```python
def print_lyrics():
    print("I'm a lumberjack")
    print("Sleep all night and work all day")
```

* The rules for function names are the same as for variable names: letters, numbers and some punctuation marks are legal, but the first character canâ€™t be a number.

### Parameters

* `parameter` is a variable which we use in the function definition

* it is a handle that allows code in the function to access the arguments for certain function invocation

### Return values

* often a function will take its args, do some computation, and `return` a value to be used as the value of the function call in the `calling expression`

### Multiple Params/Args

* can define more than one param in the function definition

* simply add more args when we call function

* match number and order of args and params

```python
def addtwo(a,b):
    added = a + b
    return added

x = addtwo(3,5)
print(x)
# 8
```
