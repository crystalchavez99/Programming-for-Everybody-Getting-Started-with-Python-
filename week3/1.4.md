# Python for Everybody

## 1.4 Writing Paragraphs of Code

### Elements of Python
* Variables and reserved words
* valid syntax patterns
* constructing a program for a purpose

Later as you write programs you will
make up your own words that have meaning to you called **variables**. You will have
great latitude in choosing your names for your variables, but you cannot use any
of Pythonâ€™s reserved words as a name for a variable.

### Reserved Words
|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|  and | del  | global  | not  | with  | as  | elif  |
| if  | or  | yield  |  assert | else  | import  | pass  |
| break   | except  | in  |  raise |  class | finally  | is  |
|  return |  continue  | for  |lambda   | try  | def  | from  |

### Sentences or Lines
```Python
x = 2   Assignment statement
x = x + 2   Assignment with expression
print(x)    print function
```

### Python Scripts
* Intereactive Python is good for experiments and programs of 3-4 lines long
* Most programs are much longer, so we put in a file and tell Python to run in the file
* Add **.py** as the suffix of these files to indicate Python

### Interactive versus Script
* Interactive
  * Type directly to Python one line at a time and responds
* Script
  * Enter sequence of statements into a file using text editor and tell Python to execute

### Program Steps or Program Flow
* Program is a sequence of steps to be done in order
* Some steps are conditional
* Some are to be repeated
* Store set of steps to be used over and over throughout the program

### Sequential Steps
```Python
x = 2 VVVV
print(x) => 2
x = x + 2 VVVV
print(x) => 4
# When a program is running, it flows from one step to the next so top to bottom
```

### Conditional Steps
```Python
x = 5
if x < 10:
    print('smaller')
if x > 20:
    print('bigger')
print('Finish')
# Smaller
# Finish
```

### Repeated Steps
```Python
n = 5
while n > 0:
    print(n)
    n = n - 1
print('Blastoff!')
# 5
# 4
# 3
# 2
# 1
# Blastoff!
Loops have iteration variables that change each time through a loop
```
