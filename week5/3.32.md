# Python for Everybody

## 3.2 More Conditional Statements

### Chained Conditionals (Multiway)

* Sometimes there are more than two possibilities and we need more than two
branches.

```python
if x < y:
    print('x is less than y')
elif x > y:
    print('x is greater than y')
else:
    print('x and y are equal')
# elif is an abbreviation of “else if.”
```

* There is no limit on the number of elif statements. If there is an else clause, it
has to be at the end, but there doesn’t have to be one.

### Catching exceptions using try and except

* Surround a dangerous section of code with `try` and `except`

* if code in `try` works, `except` is skipped

* if code in `try` fails, jumps to the `except` section

* this is used to eliminate or catch a traceback

* The idea of try and
except is that you know that some sequence of instruction(s) may have a problem
and you want to add some statements to be executed if an error occurs. These
extra statements (the except block) are ignored if there is no error.

```python inp = input('Enter Fahrenheit Temperature:')
try:
    fahr = float(inp)
    cel = (fahr - 32.0) * 5.0 / 9.0
    print(cel)
except:
    print('Please enter a number')
```
