# Python for Everybody

## 3.1 Conditional Statements

* In order to write useful programs, we almost always need the ability to check conditions
and change the behavior of the program accordingly. `Conditional statements`
give us this ability
* The boolean expression after the `if` statement is called the `condition`
  * We end the
if statement with a colon character (:) and the line(s) after the if statement are indented.
    * increase indent after if or for
    * decrease to indicate end of block
* If the logical condition is true, then the indented statement gets executed. If the
logical condition is false, the indented statement is skipped.
### Comparison Operators
* Boolean expressions ask a question to produce a yes or no result to depend control program flow
* Uses compareison operators evaluate to `True` / `False` or `YES` / `NO`
* Only looks at variables but does not change it
```python
x = 5
if x == 5:
    print("Equals 5")
if x > 4:
    print('Greater than 4')
if x >= 5:
    print("Greater than or equals to 5")
```
* True and False are special values that belong to the class `bool`, not strings

### Nested Decisions
* One conditional can also be nested within another.
```python
x = 42
if x > 1:
    print("More than one")
    if < 100:
        print("Less than 100")
print("All done!")
```

### Alternative Expression (Two Way)
* A second form of the if statement is alternative execution, in which there are two possibilities and the condition determines which one gets executed
* It's like a fork in the road, must choose one path but not both
```python
x = 4
if x > 2:
    print("Bigger")
else:
    print("smaller")
print("All done!")
